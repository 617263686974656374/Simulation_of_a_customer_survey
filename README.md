# Simulation_of_a_customer_survey
This Java program simulates a market research scenario for product evaluation. It randomly assigns ratings - 'Perfect', 'Good', or 'Not Recommended' - to a user-defined number of test cases to assess a hypothetical product. 

The user is prompted to input the number of tests to be conducted. For each test, the program generates a random number between 1 and 3, with each number corresponding to one of the three ratings. The counts for each rating are tallied as the tests are conducted.

After completing all tests, the program calculates and displays the percentage of each rating category out of the total number of tests. It then concludes with an overall assessment of the product based on which rating category has the highest count. If 'Perfect' has the highest count, the product is deemed overall perfect; if 'Good' has the highest count, the product is deemed overall good; and similarly for 'Not Recommended'.
